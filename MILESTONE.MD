# MILESTONE

GOAL: Create a Pokemon web app using data from PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) with pagination and individual Pokemon detail pages.

## V1

### Pokemon List

This component will display a grid or list of Pokemon. Each Pokemon entry should include:

- Pokemon name
- Pokemon image (use the sprites.front_default property from the API response)
- Use a library like react-paginate to handle pagination logic.
- Display page numbers or navigation buttons to allow users to switch between pages.

### V1 Progress:

- done data fetching and render 20 first pokemons with name and image
- to do:
  - pagination, fetch and render next pokemon
  - styling, try to do manual css styling, grid style

## V2

### Deployment:

Host your application on a platform like Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, or Render.io for public access.

## V3

### Pokemon Detail Page:

Clicking on a Pokemon from the list should navigate to a dedicated detail page for that Pokemon. This page should display:

- Pokemon name
- Bigger Pokemon image
- Stats: Display individual stat values (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
- Types: Show the Pokemon's primary and secondary types using type colors or icons.
- Additional details (optional): You can include information like height, weight, abilities, or moves (using separate API calls).

## V4

### Search

Implement a search bar to allow users to quickly find specific Pokemon.

## V5

### Filtering

Allow filtering by type, generation, or other criteria.

## V6

### Backend

While this can be a purely frontend application, you can optionally set up a backend server if you need features like user authentication, storing preferences, or real-time updates.

## V7

### Animations and Transitions

Use subtle animations for transitions between pages or when hovering over Pokemon entries to make the app feel more dynamic.

## V7

### Favoriting System

Allow users to mark their favorite Pokemon for easy access later. This could involve storing information in the browser's local storage or implementing a backend for user accounts.

## V8

### Team Building

Let users create teams of their favorite Pokemon, allowing them to share or compare teams with friends.

## V9

### Type Effectiveness

Integrate type effectiveness information from PokéAPI to display which types are strong or weak against a specific Pokemon.

## V10

### Evolution Chain

Show the evolution chain for each Pokemon, visually connecting its different forms.
